This section is an introduction and sets the playing field

- its dead
- instead of faster cpus, we get more of them
- the challenge is to make use of these extra cores
- one thing that is for sure is that it is rather difficult

# Parellism vs Concurrency

<!--
Here we set the stage by what we mean with concurrency
and how parallelism is a subset of concurrency

- parallelism is the effort of speeding up a computation by splitting it into isolated pieces and run them across different execution contexts (threads, processes, gpus, clusters, etc.)
- the hard part of parallism is finding those isolated pieces
- concurrency is the effort of interleaving many tasks over fewer execution contexts, with the effort of increasing utilisation by performing other work while one task is waiting

Top-down we have decomposition, bottom-up we have composition. With that we have a structured way to chop up problems into smaller ones, or compose solutions out of smaller ones.

Composition allows to compose code. We don't have composition with concurrency. We can write a function that retries another function max n times. A for loop, a counter, error handling, and forwarding the error when its retried too often. But doing this with an concurrent function requires a lot of DIY. This is because there is no standard way to call a concurrent function, so we have no way to compose them. This means there are no async algorithms readily available, so people code what they need, with all the bugs that that ensues.

---

# Unstructured Concurrency

- fire-and-forget
- unclear ownership
- unclear lifetime
- error handling is hard
- cancellation? DIY

This leads to a lot of bugs, that everyone seems to repeat.

---

# Asynchrony

Lets step back and look at the basic building block of concurrency. The asynchronous function.

What does it do?

Well, it is a function, but its asynchronous. What does that mean, for a function to be asynchronous.

Let us first look at a function. It has input, output, maybe it can throw an exception. Async functions need to do all that too, plus they have to be asynchronous.

The simplest exlpanation of asynchrony that I can come up with is that the asynchronous function *runs* somewhere else. Not on the calling stack. It might be on another thread, or one the same thread, just not a top of stack frame of the caller.

Basically we want to call a function that can outlive our stack frame.

But this kills pretty much all the lifetime and ownership guarantees we had from structured programming.

Yet this is exactly what we want, we want to run something on a separate or disjoint execution context, which one we don't care much about, as long as the calling function can continue.

- üé® **Themable** - theme can be shared and used with npm packages
- üßë‚Äçüíª **Developer Friendly** - code highlighting, live coding with autocompletion
- ü§π **Interactive** - embedding Vue components to enhance your expressions
- üé• **Recording** - built-in recording and camera view
- üì§ **Portable** - export into PDF, PNGs, or even a hostable SPA
- üõ† **Hackable** - anything possible on a webpage

# Components

<div grid="~ cols-2 gap-4">
<div>

You can use Vue components directly inside your slides.

We have provided a few built-in components like `<Tweet/>` and `<Youtube/>` that you can use directly. And adding your custom components is also super easy.

```html
<Counter :count="10" />
```

<!-- ./components/Counter.vue -->
<Counter :count="10" m="t-4" />

Check out [the guides](https://sli.dev/builtin/components.html) for more.

<div>

```html
<Tweet id="1390115482657726468" />
```

# Themes

Slidev comes with powerful theming support. Themes can provide styles, layouts, components, or even configurations for tools. Switching between themes by just **one edit** in your frontmatter:

<div grid="~ cols-2 gap-2" m="-t-2">

```yaml
---
theme: default
---
```

```yaml
---
theme: seriph
---
```

<img border="rounded" src="https://github.com/slidevjs/themes/blob/main/screenshots/theme-default/01.png?raw=true">
